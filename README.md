# Just Find It

The app was designed to help ppl to find out which series or movies is hosted at which streaming provider. Theres also an option to add favorite items to a watch list page.

This app is the result of my Web Development Bootcamp at neuefische which I attended in late 2022.

This app is optimized for mobile usage, so please set your browser to mobile version.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
